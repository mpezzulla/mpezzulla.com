		<h1>Quotes</h1>
		<div style="margin:0.25em;"></div>
		<p>This page is intended to collect phrases that I mostly encountered during my studies on books and heard during lectures and seminars.
		Sometimes they are veined with gentle irony, sometimes they are assertive and more direct, but they are always witty and thoughtful.
		I tried <i>not</i> to include the famous ones, hence you will not read Einstein here.
		I hope that at least one of them will make you smile and think.
		<p>This page is organised in two sections. The first section includes quotes that are “checkable,” hence I credit them.
		The second section reports quotes that were mostly heard by myself during lectures and seminars at MIT: since there is no source for them,
		I will just add initials to point who heard that too in the right direction.

		<h2>Checkable</h2>
		<h3><h3>About devotion to science</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Io non sono il corpo: io sono la mente. (I am not the body: I am the mind.) — Rita Levi-Montalcini
		</ul>

		<h3><h3>About how to use math</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk. — John von Neumann
			<li>[...] it should constantly be kept in mind that the mathematical system is never more than a projection of the real system on a conceptual axis. — Richard Bellman
			<li>Always consider a problem under the minimum structure in which it makes sense. — Michel Talagrand
		</ul>

		<h3>About old and new sciences</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>A concern with physical quantities – energy, temperature, and the like – has inspired the development of modern mathematics. Scientific and engineering questions have provided a source of vitality to, among other fields, algebra, geometry and analysis. A concern with logical and statistical quantities – information – is central to present-day science and engineering. The pertinent mathematics is being actively developed, as disciplines such as algorithms, complexity, communications and control motivate questions in adjoining fields such as probability, combinatorics, algebra and harmonic analysis. A common framework supporting the study of information and computation across disciplines is as yet a distant goal. — from the statement of purpose of the Center for the Mathematics of Information, Caltech

		<li>We begin with the observation that one of the basic objectives of science is to predict the future. This clairvoyance may range from that of the date of the next eclipse, earthquake, or recession, to that of the failure of a structure such as a building or bridge under sustained vibration. In this effort to foretell, the crystal ball of science is the classical descriptive approach, aided and amplified by mathematical ingenuity and the electronic computer. — Richard Bellman

		<li>Certain idealisations are always made in the construction of a mathematical model as, for example, in the neglect of certain state variables, the omission of certain interactions that simplify cause and effect relations, the simplification of the geometric structure, the assumption of instantaneous transmission of certain effects, the overlooking of various possible changes in the environment, and so on, and so on. To compensate for the effect of this initial smoothing of the scientific path, we introduce an all-purpose forcing term g(t). — Richard Bellman

		<li>[...] we must weigh the cost of undesirable performance of the system against the cost of control. This is one of the basic facts of control theory: nothing for nothing. — Richard Bellman

		<li>Two illegalities in mathematics are no worse than one! — Richard Bellman
		</ul>

		<h3>About how “religious” people are with their own field of expertise (their “toolkit” would say Richard Feynman)</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The point to emphasize is that we have once again invoked a familiar technique of analysis. A formal procedure based upon intuitive concepts is first used to obtain a relation. Once the form of the relation is observed, we can employ either an entirely differential method to establish it rigorously, or, guided by our knowledge of the desired result, return to the original method and smooth the edges. After all, we have a choice of our techniques. No holy vow has been sworn to adhere rigidly to one or the other general theories. Successful mathematical research requires eclecticism. — Richard Bellman
		</ul>

		<h3>About “simplicity”</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Gossip has it that the “supersymmetry technique” is difficult to learn. But quite to the contrary, representing determinants as Gaussian integrals over anticommuting alias Grassmann variables makes for great simplifications in computing averages over the underlying matrices. — Fritz Haake
		<li>Feynman brought quantum field theory to the masses. — Julian Schwinger
		</ul>

		<h3>About notations...</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>But neither of them [Waring and Wilson] was able to prove the theorem, and Waring confessed that the demonstration was made more difficult because no notation can be devised to express a prime number. But in our opinion truths of this kind should be drawn from notions rather than from notations. — Carl Friedrich Gauss
		<li>He [Gauss] then proceeded to give his proof, with the help of congruence notation of course. — John Stillwell
		</ul>
		<h3>About quality and quantity</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>You should always judge a mathematician by his best paper! — William Feller
		</ul>
		<h3>About why there is no applied math department at MIT</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The whole MIT is an applied mathematics department. — Gian-Carlo Rota

		<li>If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. — Isaac Newton

		<h3>About credibility</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>I don’t want to feed you my own conclusions. Convictions are stronger if they are self-generated, rather than taught. Understanding is a creative process. — David MacKay
		</ul>

		<h3>About “every little helps”</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Have no illusions. To achieve our goal of getting off fossil fuels, these reductions in demand and increases in supply must be big. Don’t be distracted by the myth that “every little helps.” If everyone does a little, we’ll achieve only a little. We must do a lot. — David MacKay

		<li>To make this comparison, we need numbers, not adjectives. — David MacKay

		<li>Err and err and err again, but less and less and less. — Piet Hein

		<li>A list is only as strong as its weakest link. — Donald Knuth
		<li>Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. — Donald Knuth
		<li>I can’t go to a restaurant and order food because I keep looking at the fonts on the menu. — Donald Knuth
		<li>Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration. — Donald Knuth
		<li>An algorithm must be seen to be believed. — Donald Knuth
		<li>Random numbers should not be generated with a method chosen at random. — Donald Knuth
		<li>We have seen that computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better. Therefore we can be glad that people who lecture at computer conferences speak of the state of the Art.

		<li>In becoming information-rich, we have become attention-poor. — Peter Nicholson, heard from Seth Lloyd

		<li>Epsilon is a small number. So small that when squared it is zero. — Leonard Susskind while lecturing on quantum mechanics

		<li>For the same reason that we no longer use a certain king's feet to measure distance, we use natural units in which the speed of light c and the Dirac symbol hbar are both set equal to 1. — Anthony Zee
		</ul>
		<h3>On perfection</h3>
		The perfect is the enemy of the good. — Orlando Pescetti, popularised by Voltaire
		Give them the third-best to go on with; the second-best comes too late; the best never comes. — Sir Robert Watson-Watt explaining the “cult of the imperfect” in engineering the early warning radar system in Britain to counter the rapid growth of the Luftwaffe.

		You're only as good as your last trade. — Wall Street folklore

		Either you give order or you take orders. — Noam Chomsky, BBC Newsnight

		<h2>Uncheckable</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Science changes by funerals. — B. G. <!-- Bob Grober -->
			<li>They say in each seminar there should be one joke and one proof: Just be sure that they are not the same. — A. B. <!-- Alexander Barvinok -->
			<li>Thank you for inviting me to this seminar series. Today I will talk <h3>About the permanent of a matrix, if there are no objections. — A. B.<!-- Alexander Barvinok -->
			<li>Life is too short for bullet points. — S. L.<!-- Seth Lloyd -->
			<li>You don't have to be shy to improve your error exponents because they will appear, sooner or later, in someone's else union bound! — Y. P.<!-- Y. P. -->
			<li>And this is another piece of wisdom I want to give you today. — Y. P.<!-- Y. P.-->
			<li>You can't beat the bound! — Y. P.<!-- Y. P. -->
		</ul>
